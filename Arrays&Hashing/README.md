**General observations about Array and Hashing related problems:**

1. Insert/delete/lookup operations in a set in python are O(1). Use set in places where frequent lookup of elements is required.
2. Use Hashmaps if we need to find a pair.
3. Use sets for anagram related operations.
4. Intuition is required for problems like product of array except itself.
5. For frequency related problems, heap or bucket sort will be helpful.
6. Encode and decode, chracter delimiters alone wont help, the frequency of the length also matters. And the length can be of more than one digit.
7. For longest consequtive sequence, start counting if the number is starting of a sequence.

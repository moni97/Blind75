**Encode and decode strings**

Notes:
1. String delimiter alone will not work, because the delimiter can be in the string itself. So add the length of the string along with the delimiter
2. Loop through every character and count the index. The length can be double digits, so calulate the index of starting and ending by looping through until the delimiter.
